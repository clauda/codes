I dedicated myself to learn about [EmberJS](http://emberjs.com) and I started a new application: a sample blog with NodeJS and Moongose. If I liked Ember? No. Ember confuses me too. I couldn't use all features, so I'm still team AngularJS.

Live on [getup](http://nodejam-sorta.getup.io/).

Find the code on [my github](http://github.com/krawdyah/nodejam) and feel free to collaborate, improve it, refactor and solve [issues](http://github.com/krawdyah/nodejam/issues). I'll keep learning, so I hope for help.
